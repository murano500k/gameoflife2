## Full Description (4000 characters max)

Discover the fascinating world of cellular automata with Game of Life, an elegant simulation of Conway's famous mathematical game.

**What is the Game of Life?**
Created by mathematician John Conway in 1970, the Game of Life is a zero-player game where patterns evolve based on simple rules. Cells live or die depending on their neighbors, creating mesmerizing emergent behavior from chaos.

**Features:**

🔬 **20+ Classic Patterns**
Explore a curated collection of famous patterns across 6 categories:
• Still Lifes - Stable patterns that never change (Block, Beehive, Loaf)
• Oscillators - Patterns that repeat cyclically (Blinker, Pulsar, Pentadecathlon)
• Spaceships - Patterns that travel across the grid (Glider, Lightweight Spaceship)
• Methuselahs - Small patterns with long evolution times (R-pentomino, Acorn)
• Guns - Patterns that produce infinite streams of gliders (Gosper Glider Gun)
• And more unique patterns to discover!

🎨 **Beautiful Design**
• Modern neon-inspired visuals
• Smooth animations
• Dark theme optimized for OLED screens

⚡ **Full Control**
• Play, pause, and step through generations
• Adjustable simulation speed
• Customizable grid size
• Tap to toggle cells
• Place patterns anywhere on the grid

📚 **Learn as You Play**
Each pattern includes:
• Description explaining what makes it special
• Interesting facts about its discovery and behavior
• Live preview before placing

🔒 **Privacy First**
• No ads
• No tracking
• No data collection
• Works completely offline
• No permissions required

Whether you're a math enthusiast, a computer science student, or simply curious about emergent complexity, Game of Life offers endless exploration. Watch simple rules create intricate patterns, discover how chaos leads to order, and understand why this simple game has captivated scientists and hobbyists for over 50 years.
